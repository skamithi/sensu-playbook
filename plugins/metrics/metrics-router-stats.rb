#
#   routing protocol statistics
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   Returns Routing protocol neighbor count and total route count.
#   This can be applied to a time series graph to check for major fluctuations.
#   If major fluctations occur with these route counts, then it is a sign that
#   something is wrong with the switch. Specifically written to work on Cumulus
#   Linux. Makes use the non-modal CLI created by Cumulus Linux
#
# OUTPUT:
#   Generates 2 events.
#   1. routes_stats metric event. Output
#      - list of routes
#      - total route count learned from that routing protocol
#   2. peer_stats metric event. Output:
#      - total peer count
#      - list of peer IPs in a working state (currently only supports BGP)
#      - peer  working state count
#      - list of peers not in a working state (currently works only for BGP)
#      - peer not working state count
#

#   Linux
